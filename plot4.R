# Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?
# Reference 1: http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/219472.pdf
# Reference 2: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/net/2011nei/2011_neiv1_tsd_draft.pdf
# Reference 3. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4220631/how-do-i-grep-in-r

# Here are some of the processes we deployed to isolate the data for emissions from Coal combustions:

# 1. According to the literature (see the three pdf links in this thread), there are four sectors (EI.Sector) dealing with Coal combustion:
## Fuel Comb - Comm/Institutional - Coal
## Fuel Comb - Electric Generation - Coal
## Fuel Comb - Industrial Boilers, ICEs - Coal
## Fuel Comb - Residential - Other

# 2.  Subsetted the SCC dataset on the four Coal combustion sectors

# 3. Examines structure and full records of the subsets and found that two of the four SCCs in the Fuel Comb -Residential - Other are not related to Coal Combustion.

# 4. Combined (rbind()) the subsets into a one subset of the SCC dataset on Coal Combustion; lets call this X. X has 101 SCCs.

# 5. Conducted a search of "Coal" in SCC$SCC.Level.Three

# 6. Subsetted SCC on the outcome of the search in [5] above; lets call this Y. Y has 172 SCCs.

# 7. Examine the discrepancies  between X and Y using x <- xX$CC %in% Y$SCC, y <- Y$SCC %in% X$SCC; X[!x]; Y[!y];

# 8. Examined the differences datasets and of course accepted all of X since they are explicitly coded as Coal combustion; and found seven SCCs in Y but not in X that deal with Coal combustion

# 9. Created a new X to include the seven SCCs

# 10. Subsetted NEI on the SCCs of new X in step [9]

# 11. Integrity check issues: There are 108 unique SCCs in new X; but there are only 89 unique SCCs in the subset of NEI (see step [10]) based on the 108 SCCs.

# 12. Final subset of NEI has 40,639 observations on unique SCCs.

# While working on fisnishing up the task, I received a related query about searching the Short.Name feature for "Coal" and "Comb". 
# What follows is a feedback from the exercise

# F1. I searched SCC$Short.Name as was uggested by atopos: grep("Comb.*Coal|Coal.*Comb", SCC$Short.Name, ignore.case=FALSE)

# F2. The search returned 91 SCCs in the SCC data frame:  SCC$SCC[grep("Comb.*Coal|Coal.*Comb", SCC$Short.Name, ignore.case=FALSE)]

# F3. Only two of the 91 SCCs were not in the list of SCCs gotten from sector search (see previous post on sectored (EI.Sector) search)

# F4. The two SCCs deal with Coal Combustion; hence they were added to the sectored outcome; So we are up to 103 = (101 + 2) SCCs. See step 4 above.

# F5.  I subsetted NEI data frame on those 103 SCCs.

# F6. This is were things got interesting:
### I got 40,475 observations on 83 unique SCCs from the search of Short.Name and Sector
### Recall that the search of the sectors given in step 1 (above) augmented by a search for "Coal" in SCC.Level.Three had returned 40,639 observations on 89 unique SCCs. 

### A comparison of the sectored approach SCCs (in steps 1-12) and the Short.Named (Short.Name) approach (in steps F1-F5) showed that the Short.Named approach returns a subset of the sectored SCCs.
### The following six SCCs in the sectored search are not in the Short.Named search: 39000299, 39000289, 39000203, 39000201, 39000199, & 39000189

# There are four cases in "Fuel Comb - Residential - Other" sector, two d[1:2, ] are related to Coal combustion: Anthracite Coal; Bituminous/Subbituminous Coal

# Extract data related to coal combustion from d: Anthracite Coal; Bituminous/Subbituminous Coal
dCoal <- d[1:2, ]

# combine a, b, c and dCoal into one dataset of emissions from motor vehicles 

coalCombBySector <- data.frame(rbind(a, b, c, dCoal)) # Concludes Steps 1-4 (Sector search)
str(coalCombBySector)

# There are 101 SCCs identified as coal combustion sources in the SCC dataset via the method above
# Note that searching the word "Coal" in EI.Sector would have yielded 99 SCCs, because two SCCs are embedded in the "Fuel - Comb - Residential - Other" sector and cannot be retrieved by searching at the sector level.
# By examining the cases in the "Fuel - Comb - Residential - Other" sector we were able to identify the two SCCs associated with coal combustion.
